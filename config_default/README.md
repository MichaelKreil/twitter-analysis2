configuration stuff ...  

Sorry, but I can't publish the keys to our authentication. So you have to register you own app at https://apps.twitter.com and generate your own tokens.

When you are finished, you can update `config.js` and `tokens.tsv` and rename the folder to `config`.

## config.js

needs consumer key and consumer secret. Can be generated at https://apps.twitter.com

## tokens.tsv

list of OAuth-Tokens, has 4 columns:

- user id
- user screen_name
- OAuth token
- OAuth secret
